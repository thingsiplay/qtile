"""
To setup, you need to configure the widget itself:

    * set the "profile" to the main folder of your Thunderbirdird profile,
    in example: "~/.thunderbird/xxxxxx.default"
    * set the "update_interval", if default value is not sufficient

Next configure Thunderbird:

    * show "Unified Folders" by clicking on "...", on the right from
    "Folders"
    * open "Properties" on Inbox in Unified Folders (right mouse click on
    Inbox)
    * click button "Choose..." to open a dialog to select which mail
    accounts to include
    * scroll the list and enabled checkbox on those lines labled with
    "Inbox"
    * click "Ok" to close that dialog and "Update" to close previous
    dialog

Now the widget should be able to read new messages from activated mails
and even feeds. The widget will update after "update_interval" in seconds
or if left mouse click on widget. Additionally widget is updated when
Thunderbird client window gets or loses focus.
